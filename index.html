    <h1>Welcome to Nick's very own favorite hiking places!</h1>

    <p>Living in Central Massachusetts has a lot of benefits especially when
        it comes to the ourdoors. As an avid hiker and outdoorsman, I've found
        plenty of option for myself that I would like to share with you. Hopefully
        you can visit some of these place to find peace and enjoyment within them!
