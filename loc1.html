    <p style="font: size large 29px; font-family: sans-serif;"> Redemption Rock is a great place with a very interesting history behind it.
        Angered by the spread of colonial settlements westward, the chief Metacomet 
        (known to European settlers as King Philip) led the Nipmuc, Narragansett, and Wampanoag in defense of their land. In February 1676, 
        several hundred indigenous peoples attacked Lancaster and captured Mary White Rowlandson, her three children, and 20 others, and took
         them into the wilderness for several months. They returned to Lancaster in late April 1676 where, as the inscription says, John Hoar
        of Concord negotiated Marys release at this huge, flat-topped granite ledge.</p>

    <p>The Midstate Trail passes right through Redemption Rock, so you can choose which way to go
        I have yet taken the other path, but the one I did take was beautiful and felt so serene!</p>
