    <p style="font: size large 29px; font-family: sans-serif;">Redemption Rock is a hiking trail near Leominster state Forest in Princeton, MA.
        Upon entering the hiking trail, you will see a sign with some of the history associated with this rock.</p>

    <p>The Midstate Trail passes right through Redemption Rock, so you can choose which way to go
        I have yet taken the other path, but the one I did take was beautiful and felt so serene!</p>
