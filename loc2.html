    <H1 style="color: blueviolet; font-size: 28px;"> Sterling Rail Trail</H1>

    <p> Sterling is a city not too far from Leominster. As a matter of fact,
        it's about only a 10-15 min drive depending on traffic that day. <br>The
        Sterling Rail Trail is a higher traffic trail that you can find right
        next to downtown Sterling and next to Oh My Gosh Antiques.</p>
    </p>

   <h3> Here are a few reasons on why I like this trail! </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>It's all flat making it a non-intense walk</li>
        <li>The amount of wildlife here is more than you think. I've seen Bobcats!</li>
        <li>It's really not far from where I live making it an ideal driving distance.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Reasons why this trail may not be for you.</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>There are a lot of people that come to walk this trail.</li>
        <li>Although there is a lot of nature, there are a lot of houses and buisnesses around too.</li>
        <li>It could be too short of a trail for some.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> The path is a decent walk to a beautiful view of lakes and the surrounding wildlife forests.
        You will <br> most likely see a decent amount of people along your way. A simple nod or "hello" will suffice. After <br>
        about 15-20 mins, you will see plenty of views like this one!
